This thesis seeks to analyze the determinants of county-level accumulated death rate caused by
COVID-19 (measured in deaths per thousand people). We accumulated county-level death cases
from January 21 2020, when the first reported coronavirus case took place in Washington, to
April 12 2021. We used the death rate per thousand people to measure the severity of the
pandemic in each county. Demographic and climate related features were included to picture
the difference between counties and detect how they might affect the fatality rates. Using our
data, we showed that higher population density, larger proportion of elder population, lower
median household income and lower education level were associated with higher death rate.
Proportion of minority races: Black, Asian and Hispanic, contributed to the difference of fatality
rates as well, though a higher proportion of Asian population was correlated with a lower death
rate whereas blacks and Hispanics were higher. The thesis also provided evidence that scientific
interventions can effectively decrease the overall death rate: vaccinations and high propensity of
wearing masks contributed to a decrease in the death rate. Warmer weather climate is also
shown to have a negative effect on the death toll, while rainfall (proportion of rainy days in a
year) and wind speed show the opposite effect.
